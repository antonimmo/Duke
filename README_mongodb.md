## MongoDB as Datasource

This implementation based on no.priv.garshol.duke.datasources.JDBCDataSource.


## Example of use.

Suppose you have a collection named "newUsers" in a "gatheredData" DB. 

If this is the "schema":

```javascript
{
 _id: ObjectId("54107bb33f2a38e1e44e9961"),
 name:"Adolf",
 address:{
  street:"Rue Av.",
  number: 102,
  zip-code: 4106
 }
}
```

and you just want to consider "name" and "address.zip-code" fields:

```xml
<data-source class="no.priv.garshol.duke.datasources.MongoDBDataSource">
 <param name="server-address" value="domain.com"/>
 <param name="port-number" value="27017"/>
 <param name="database" value="gatheredData"/>
 <param name="collection" value="newUsers"/>
 <param name="projection" value="{_id:0, name:1, address.zip-code:1}"/>
 
 <column property="Name" name="name"/>
 <column property="ZipCode" name="address.zip-code"/>
</data-source>
```

Note that the fields "name" and "address.zip-code" have been mapped into "Name" and "ZipCode" in the column definition.

### Parameters

- Required:
 * database
 * collection

- Optional (and default values):
 * server-address: "localhost"
 * port-number: "27017:
 * db-auth: "false" (other possible values: "true" and "admin", case unsensitive)
 * user-name: required if db-auth is set to "true" or "admin"
 * password: same as user-name
 * cursor-notimeout: "false" (can be set to "true")
 * query: "{}" (query all documents in the collection)
 * projection
 
### Behavior

1. If a parameter is invalid (port-number, server-address, collection, etc.) an error will be thrown.
2. When cursor-notimeout is not set (or set to "false") and BATCH_SIZE < db[collection].count(query), it's possible that when Duke is trying to fetch the rest of the data (it performs a MongoDB getmore) the cursor is already timed out. To prevent this, set cursor-notimeout to "true".
3. If db-auth is set to "true", the connection will try to find the credentials (user+password) in the DB specified in the database parameter. If is set to "admin", will try to find them in the admin DB. It this is set to a different value, this setting will be ignored and the field will preserve its default value.
4. Setting parameters to "" is the same that not setting them, except for port-number (an error with a custom message will be thrown).
5. The query and projection parameters have to be valid JSON formatted. There's no need to add quotes, even if they operate on a nested field. If format is not valid, an error will be thrown.
6. You could skip the projection operator and perform the projection in the column definition, but a lot of very large documents would imply a significant slowdown caused by network traffic.
7. The query document can contain operators like $orderby, $showDiskLoc, etc. See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query-modifier/

### Future improvements
1. Deal with arrays of values and arrays of documents. Given that Duke supports multivalued columns, this is desired.
2. Accept different authentication methods.
3. Temporary index creation if needed.
